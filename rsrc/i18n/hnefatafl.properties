The game of Hnefatafl simulates an epic battle. The black attackers' goal is to capture the red king. The white defenders' goal is to escort the king to safety.\
<p><i>Instructions</i><br>To select a piece, click on it. To move a piece, select it then click the space to which you wish to move. The game interface provides several visual cues to guide you through this process. Whenever you hover the mouse cursor over a piece that has a valid move available to it a translucent blue selector box will appear above it. Upon selecting a piece the selector box will become solid. With a piece selected, hovering the mouse cursor over a space to which the piece may move will show a translucent piece over the space.</p> \
<p><i>Rules</i><br><b>Movement:</b> Turns alternate between players with Black making the first move. On her turn a player must move a piece of her colour any number of spaces along either orthogonal direction (i.e., up-down or left-right but not diagonally) so long as the piece has a clear path to its destination (i.e., a piece may not jump over other pieces). Only the king may move on to the throne at the centre of the board or the four corners. </p> \
<p><b>Capture:</b> Pieces may capture one or more pieces of the opposing colour by moving to bracket them on opposite sides; captured pieces are removed from the board. A player may sandwich a piece to be captured between two of her pieces, or between one of her pieces and a corner. Only the moving piece may initiate a capture, hence a piece may safely position itself inside a sandwich. The diagrams below show 1. Black capturing a single White piece, 2. Black capturing two White pieces simultaneously, 3. Black capturing a White piece using the corner, and 4. White safely positioning itself between two Black pieces respectively.</p> \

<p>Capturing the king requires more effort; he must be surrounded on all four sides. The edges of the board, throne, and corners are all considered Black pieces when determining if the king is surrounded. The following diagrams illustrate several ways in which the fleeing monarch may be apprehended.</p> \

<p><b>Winning:</b> White wins if the King escapes to safety by moving to one of the four corners of the game board. Black wins upon capturing the King. The game ends in a stalemate if the current player has no valid moves available.</p> \
